## ✈️ 1. Master the Art of Finding Cheap Flights

Flights are often the biggest expense, but there are many ways to save:

- **Book 2-3 months in advance** for international flights, 1-2 months for domestic
- **Fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays** - typically 20-30% cheaper than weekends
- **Use incognito mode** when searching to avoid price increases based on cookies
- **Set price alerts** on Google Flights and Skyscanner
- **Consider nearby airports** - sometimes flying into a smaller airport saves hundreds
- **Be flexible with dates** - shifting by a day or two can save 40%+

## 🏨 2. Save Big on Accommodation

Accommodation is your second-biggest expense, but you have many budget-friendly options:

### Hostels (Not Just for Young Backpackers!)

Modern hostels offer private rooms, great amenities, and social atmospheres. Average cost: $15-40/night.

### Budget Hotels & Guesthouses

Compare prices across all major booking platforms to find the best deals.
