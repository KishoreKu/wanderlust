## 🐾 Which Dogs Should Avoid These Foods?

Not every "top brand" is right for every dog.

**You should consult your vet before switching if your dog:**

- ⚠️ Has food allergies or chronic digestive issues
- ⚠️ Is on prescription or therapeutic diets
- ⚠️ Is a senior dog with kidney, liver, or mobility concerns
- ⚠️ Is a growing puppy requiring breed-specific nutrition

**This guide is designed for general decision support, not medical diagnosis.**

---

## 🔍 Choosing the Right Food for Your Dog

If you're unsure where to start, use this simple guide:

- **High-energy / active dogs** → Higher protein, balanced fats
- **Sensitive stomachs** → Limited ingredient or easily digestible formulas
- **Weight management** → Controlled calorie density, higher fiber
- **Senior dogs** → Joint support, moderate protein, easier digestion

**The "best" dog food is the one your dog thrives on consistently.**

## 💡 What to Look for on Dog Food Labels

When comparing brands, check for:

1. **Named meat source as first ingredient** (e.g., "chicken" not "poultry meal")
2. **AAFCO statement** - Confirms nutritional adequacy
3. **Life stage appropriateness** - Puppy, adult, or senior
4. **Avoid fillers** - Excessive corn, wheat, soy as primary ingredients
5. **Check guaranteed analysis** - Protein, fat, fiber percentages

---

## 🚫 Common Dog Food Myths (Debunked)

### Myth 1: "Grain-free is always better"
**Reality:** Most dogs digest grains just fine. Grain-free is only necessary for dogs with specific grain allergies.

### Myth 2: "More expensive = better quality"
**Reality:** Price doesn't always equal quality. Focus on ingredients and AAFCO certification.

### Myth 3: "Dogs need variety like humans"
**Reality:** Dogs thrive on consistency. Frequent food changes can upset their digestive system.

## 🐕 Final Thoughts: There's No "Perfect" Dog Food — Only the Right Fit

The best dog food is the one that:

- ✅ **Your dog enjoys** - They should eat it willingly
- ✅ **Supports long-term health** - Shiny coat, healthy weight, good energy
- ✅ **Matches your vet's guidance** - Especially for dogs with health conditions
- ✅ **Fits your budget** - Consistency matters more than premium pricing

**Gubbu isn't here to sell products — we help you decide.**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: Making the Switch

If you're changing your dog's food:

1. **Transition gradually** - Mix 25% new food with 75% old for 3-4 days
2. **Increase slowly** - Move to 50/50, then 75/25 over 7-10 days
3. **Monitor closely** - Watch for digestive issues or allergic reactions
4. **Consult your vet** - Especially for dogs with existing health conditions

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is grain-free dog food better?

**Not always.** Grain-free diets are helpful for dogs with specific allergies, but many dogs digest grains well. Some studies have linked grain-free diets to heart issues in certain breeds. Consult a vet before switching.

### How often should I change my dog's food?

**Only when needed** — life-stage changes, health concerns, or vet advice. Sudden changes can upset digestion. If you do switch, transition gradually over 7-10 days.

### Can puppies eat adult dog food?

**Generally no.** Puppies need higher calories and nutrients (especially DHA, calcium, and protein) for proper growth and development. Always choose puppy-specific formulas.

### What ingredients should I avoid?

**Watch out for:**
- Artificial colors and flavors
- Vague meat by-products ("meat meal" without specifying the source)
- Excessive fillers (corn, wheat, soy as primary ingredients)
- Unnamed animal sources ("animal fat" instead of "chicken fat")

### Should I consult a vet before switching brands?

**Yes, especially for:**
- Senior dogs or those with medical conditions
- Dogs with food allergies or sensitivities
- Puppies transitioning from mother's milk
- Dogs on prescription diets
