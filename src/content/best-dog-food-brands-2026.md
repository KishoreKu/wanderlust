## 💡 What to Look for on Dog Food Labels

When comparing brands, check for:

1. **Named meat source as first ingredient** (e.g., "chicken" not "poultry meal")
2. **AAFCO statement** - Confirms nutritional adequacy
3. **Life stage appropriateness** - Puppy, adult, or senior
4. **Avoid fillers** - Excessive corn, wheat, soy as primary ingredients
5. **Check guaranteed analysis** - Protein, fat, fiber percentages

## 🚫 Common Dog Food Myths (Debunked)

### Myth 1: "Grain-free is always better"
**Reality:** Most dogs digest grains just fine. Grain-free is only necessary for dogs with specific grain allergies.

### Myth 2: "More expensive = better quality"
**Reality:** Price doesn't always equal quality. Focus on ingredients and AAFCO certification.

### Myth 3: "Dogs need variety like humans"
**Reality:** Dogs thrive on consistency. Frequent food changes can upset their digestive system.

## 🐕 Final Thoughts: There's No "Perfect" Dog Food — Only the Right Fit

The best dog food is the one that:

- ✅ **Your dog enjoys** - They should eat it willingly
- ✅ **Supports long-term health** - Shiny coat, healthy weight, good energy
- ✅ **Matches your vet's guidance** - Especially for dogs with health conditions
- ✅ **Fits your budget** - Consistency matters more than premium pricing

**Gubbu isn't here to sell products — we help you decide.**

## 🎯 Next Steps: Making the Switch

If you're changing your dog's food:

1. **Transition gradually** - Mix 25% new food with 75% old for 3-4 days
2. **Increase slowly** - Move to 50/50, then 75/25 over 7-10 days
3. **Monitor closely** - Watch for digestive issues or allergic reactions
4. **Consult your vet** - Especially for dogs with existing health conditions
