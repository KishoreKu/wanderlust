Timing is everything when planning your European adventure! Visit during the right season and you'll enjoy perfect weather, fewer crowds, and better prices. Here's your comprehensive guide to the best time to visit Europe's most popular cities.

## 🗼 Paris, France

**Best Time: April-June & September-October**

Spring (April-June) brings blooming gardens, pleasant temperatures (15-20°C), and outdoor café culture. Fall (September-October) offers beautiful autumn colors and harvest season.

**Avoid:** August (many locals vacation, some restaurants close) and December-February (cold and rainy).

### Where to Stay in Paris

**💡 Pro Tip:** Book 2-3 months ahead for spring and fall!

## 🏛️ Rome, Italy

**Best Time: April-May & September-October**

Warm beach weather without summer crowds. Perfect for exploring Gaudí's architecture and enjoying tapas on terraces.
