## Final Thoughts

Visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau is not entertainment or typical tourism. It's an act of remembrance, education, and moral responsibility. The experience will be difficult, emotionally draining, and profoundly moving.

But it's also essential. In a world where Holocaust denial still exists and antisemitism persists, bearing witness to this history becomes even more important. By visiting, learning, and sharing what you've learned, you help ensure that the victims are remembered and that the lessons of the Holocaust are never forgotten.

**"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."** – George Santayana

Plan your visit with respect, approach it with an open heart and mind, and carry the lessons forward.

**Never forget.**
