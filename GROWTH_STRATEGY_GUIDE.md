## 🔍 SEO Strategy (Get Free Traffic from Google)

### On-Page SEO

**For Every Blog Post:**
1. **Target one main keyword**
   - Use Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest
   - Look for 1,000-10,000 monthly searches
   - Low competition keywords

2. **Optimize title and headings**
   - Include keyword in H1 (title)
   - Use keyword variations in H2s
   - Example: "Best Time to Visit Japan: Month-by-Month Guide"

3. **Meta description**
   - 150-160 characters
   - Include keyword and call-to-action
   - Example: "Discover the best time to visit Japan! Complete month-by-month weather guide, festivals, and travel tips. Plan your perfect trip now!"

4. **Internal linking**
   - Link to 3-5 other blog posts
   - Use descriptive anchor text
   - Example: "Check out our [complete Tokyo travel guide](#)"

5. **Image optimization**
   - Descriptive file names: `bali-beach-sunset.jpg` not `IMG_1234.jpg`
   - Add alt text with keywords
   - Compress images (use TinyPNG)

### Long-Tail Keywords (Easier to Rank)
Focus on specific, detailed searches:
- ❌ "Japan travel" (too competitive)
- ✅ "3 day Tokyo itinerary first time visitors"
- ✅ "best budget hotels in Bali under $50"
- ✅ "how to get from Bangkok airport to city center"

### Content Clusters
Create topic clusters to dominate search results:

**Example: Bali Cluster**
- Main pillar: "Complete Bali Travel Guide"
- Supporting posts:
  - "Best Areas to Stay in Bali"
  - "Bali Budget Breakdown: Daily Costs"
  - "10 Best Beaches in Bali"
  - "Bali Visa Requirements 2025"
  - Link all these together!

## 💰 Maximizing Affiliate Revenue

### Strategic Link Placement

**High-converting locations:**
1. **Within first 300 words** - Readers are most engaged
2. **After providing value** - Don't link immediately
3. **In comparison tables** - "Best Hotels in Bali" with booking links
4. **In practical sections** - "Where to Stay" sections
5. **At the end** - Clear call-to-action

### Content Types That Convert Best

**1. Destination Guides**
- Include hotel recommendations with affiliate links
- Flight search widgets

- "7-Day Thailand Itinerary"
- Link to hotels and flights for each day
- Readers are ready to book!

**4. Travel Deals & Alerts**
- "Cheap Flights to Europe This Month"
- Time-sensitive = urgency to book

### Trust-Building (Critical for Conversions!)
- ✅ Use real photos from your travels
- ✅ Share personal experiences
- ✅ Be honest about pros and cons
- ✅ Disclose affiliate relationships clearly
